# Encouragement
Encouragement is a program designed for *Programming 1 - Java*'s *Encouragement APP* assignment.

## Assignment Instructions:
Utilize the Scanner object to prompt the user for their full name.
Store the user's name, and give them a message of encouragement which uses their entire name.

## Details
This program promps the user for their username, validates it is a correct name, and properly capitalizes it.
The program then converts the name to a User and passes it into UserEncouragement, which randomly selects 3 slices of a positive sentence to assmble a compliment for you.
If the name is incorrect or invalid, the program re-prompts for information.

## Run
> Hi! What's your full name?

*this is a phrase that won't work*

> That's not a full name! Try again.

*Super Cool Guy*

> Hey Super Cool Guy, good work so far. See you later!
